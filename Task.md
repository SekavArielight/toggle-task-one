# Assignment: My First Web Page (Bio Card + Contact Form)
 Objective
This week’s project will help you apply the HTML concepts you’ve learned to build a personal bio card alongside a simple contact form.

By completing this, you’ll demonstrate your ability to structure content, use semantic HTML, and create accessible forms.

Project Requirements
Bio Card Section
Include:
Your full name
A profile image (can be your real photo or an avatar)
A short bio (2–3 sentences)

Use semantic elements such as:
<header> for your name/title
<section> for the bio
<nav> or <ul> for social links
Contact Form Section
Include:
Name input field (<input type="text">)
Email input field (<input type="email">)
Message textarea
Submit button
Each field must have a <label> for accessibility
Use placeholder text where appropriate
Page Structure & Accessibility

Ensure all images have alt attributes
Properly nest elements and maintain indentation
Folder Structure
A main project folder named:
